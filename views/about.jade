    | Hello, my name is <b>Stephen Timko</b> and I am a <b>Web Developer</b> from New Jersey. 
    | Ever since I was a young lad I have always had a passion for technology, and immersive, well designed user experiences.
    | This passion still thrives today and has also blossomed into my love for development, tinkering with new technologies, and building ground breaking software.
    | Most recently I have working at a company called <a href="http//:www.cignium.com" target="_blank">Cignium Technologies</a> where I have been collaborating on a team
    | building an enterprise suite of web based applications using <b>Javascript</b>, <b>Coffeescript</b>, <b>HTML 5</b>, <b>CSS</b>/<b>Stylus</b>, and <b>Node.js</b>.
